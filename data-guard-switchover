======= Switchover

Prerequisites:
✔ Ensure log shipping is working (SELECT THREAD#, SEQUENCE#, APPLIED FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG;)
✔ Verify Redo Apply is active (SELECT PROCESS, STATUS FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;)
✔ Verify Flashback is enabled (SELECT FLASHBACK_ON FROM V$DATABASE;)
✔ Ensure connectivity is fine between primary & standby.

Step 1: Verify Primary Readiness (Run on Primary):

SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;
--
Possible Outputs & Meaning:
TO STANDBY → Primary is ready for switchover ✅

Step 2: Switch Primary to Standby (Run on Primary):

ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;
--
This will convert the primary database into a standby database.

Now shut down the primary and start it in standby mode:

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;

Step 3: Activate Standby as New Primary (Run on Standby)
On the standby, check readiness:

SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;
--
TO PRIMARY → Standby is ready to become primary ✅

Now, switch the standby to primary:

ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY;

Then, open the new primary database:

ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Step 4: Start Redo Apply on the New Standby (Run on Old Primary)
Go to the old primary (which is now standby) and start redo apply:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

Step 5: Verify Data Guard After Switchover
On the new primary, check if log shipping is working:

SELECT THREAD#, SEQUENCE#, APPLIED FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG ORDER BY SEQUENCE# DESC;

On the new standby, check redo apply process:

SELECT PROCESS, STATUS FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;


***** Updated Configuration After Switchover

On the New Primary (Old Standby):

ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='LOCATION=USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST VALID_FOR=(ALL_LOGFILES,ALL_ROLES) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=fooddrdb' SCOPE=BOTH;
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='SERVICE=fooddb ASYNC VALID_FOR=(ONLINE_LOGFILES,PRIMARY_ROLE) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=fooddb' SCOPE=BOTH;

On the New Standby (Old Primary):

ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='LOCATION=/u01/app/oracle/recovery_area/ VALID_FOR=(ALL_LOGFILES,ALL_ROLES) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=fooddb' SCOPE=BOTH;
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='SERVICE=fooddrdb ASYNC VALID_FOR=(ONLINE_LOGFILES,STANDBY_ROLE) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=fooddrdb' SCOPE=BOTH;


Restart the log apply process on the new standby:

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;
alter database open;
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

Then, check if logs are being shipped and applied correctly:

SELECT DEST_ID, STATUS, ERROR FROM V$ARCHIVE_DEST WHERE DEST_ID=2;
SELECT PROCESS, STATUS, THREAD#, SEQUENCE# FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;
select open_mode,database_role from v$database;
